# Change 019: Make the Warp bind host and port configurable

The web server always bound Warp's default host on a port fixed in code, so an
app running behind a reverse proxy could not restrict itself to loopback and
could not choose its port without building a `WebTransport` by hand. The
maintainer accepted a loopback-bind fix and asked to "make the port configurable
too". `WebTransport` gains a `host` field (default `"*4"`, all IPv4 interfaces —
exactly what `Warp.run` bound before, so behaviour is unchanged) and `Application` gains `withHost` and `withPort`
builders next to the other `with*` builders. `runTransport` now starts Warp with
`runSettings` built from that host and port, and logs `<host>:<port>`.

Input contract: the host is a Warp wildcard (`"*"`, `"*4"`, `"*6"`) or a bare
literal address / hostname; the port is `1..65535`. An empty host, a URL or path
in the host field, a `host:port` pair, whitespace, port `0` or an out-of-range
port is rejected before any socket is opened, with an error that names the
builder (`Application.withHost: …` / `Application.withPort: …`). A bind the OS
refuses (port in use, address not owned) fails with
`WebTransport could not bind <host>:<port>: …` instead of an uncaught
`IOException`; the `Task.finally` cleanup in `Application.run` still releases
the resources the run owns (JWKS manager, dispatcher, file upload).

## Contract delta

`WebTransport` and `Application` are public records, so adding a field changes
their constructor signature lines (a `-`/`+` pair each). `runTransports` gains
the two optional overrides that carry `withHost` / `withPort` to the transport.
`hostPreference` and `warpSettings` are the small, testable conversion from the
transport's host and port to Warp settings. `applyBindOverrides` is the pure
override rule; `validateBindHost` / `validateBindPort` are the pure input checks
that `runWebTransport` runs before starting Warp.

## User impact

Breaking only for code that builds the records positionally or with every field
named; nothing else changes. Apps that use `WebTransport.server` and apps built with `Application.new`
and the `with*` builders are unaffected and keep binding all IPv4 interfaces
on port 8080 unless they opt in; an app that already sets `server { port = ... }`
keeps that port, because an absent `withPort` preserves the transport's own
setting. Migration: a program that writes `WebTransport { ... }` with all fields
must add `host = "*4"` (the previous behaviour) or `host = "127.0.0.1"` for
loopback only; a program that writes `Application { ... }` with all fields must
add `bindHost = Nothing` and `bindPort = Nothing`. The testbed uses
`WebTransport.server` with no overrides, so its behaviour is unchanged.
New ways to use it: `Application.withHost "127.0.0.1"` and
`Application.withPort 9090`; `host` also accepts `"*"`, `"*4"`, `"*6"` or a
literal address. Loopback-only is the right choice when the reverse proxy runs
in the same network namespace as the app (same host or container, or a shared
pod network); a proxy in a separate namespace cannot reach the listener through
its own loopback and needs a non-loopback bind. A mistyped host or port now fails
at startup with a message naming the builder, instead of binding something
unintended or dying with a raw `IOException`.

## ADR

[ADR-0079](../decisions/0079-configurable-web-bind-host-and-port.md): why the
default stays `"*4"` (no new IPv6 surface) and why the overrides live on `Application`.

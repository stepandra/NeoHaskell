# Change 017: Add an S3-compatible BlobStore backend

Applications that deploy outside a single machine cannot keep uploads in
`BlobStore/Local.hs` (ephemeral disks, several replicas). Issue #370 asks for
an S3 backend. Per the maintainer's review of the first attempt: the backend
must be a record "like `BlobStore/Local.hs`, configuration managed completely
by the blob store module", AWS-agnostic, built on the Core `Http.Client`
rather than a raw HTTP library, with credentials supplied by the application's
own `Config.hs`/`App.hs`, and tested against a mock HTTP server rather than a
real S3 service. This change delivers exactly that facade: `S3Config` plus
`createBlobStore`, the four `BlobStore` operations, hand-written SigV4 (no new
dependency), one request per operation, no retries, no redirects.

```yaml spec

```

## Contract delta

Depends on change 016 (`Http.Client.sendSecure` / `Http.Client.Internal.sendRaw`)
and change 021 (`Crypto.sha256`, `Crypto.hmacSha256`, `Crypto.toHex`); this PR
is stacked on them, so `SigV4` imports nothing from `crypton` or
`Data.ByteArray` and never unwraps `Bytes`. `SigV4` is exported as its own module so the signing
steps are unit-testable against the AWS reference vectors; applications are
expected to use only `S3Config` and `createBlobStore`.

```diff signatures
+ Service.FileUpload.BlobStore.S3: data S3Config = S3Config {endpoint :: Text, bucket :: Text, region :: Text, accessKeyId :: Text, secretAccessKey :: Text}
+ Service.FileUpload.BlobStore.S3: createBlobStore :: S3Config -> Task Text BlobStore
+ Service.FileUpload.BlobStore.S3.SigV4: data Credentials = Credentials {accessKeyId :: Text, secretAccessKey :: Text, region :: Text}
+ Service.FileUpload.BlobStore.S3.SigV4: data CanonicalRequest = CanonicalRequest {method :: Text, path :: Text, query :: Array (Text, Text), headers :: Array (Text, Text), payloadHash :: Text}
+ Service.FileUpload.BlobStore.S3.SigV4: canonicalRequest :: CanonicalRequest -> Text
+ Service.FileUpload.BlobStore.S3.SigV4: stringToSign :: Credentials -> DateTime -> CanonicalRequest -> Text
+ Service.FileUpload.BlobStore.S3.SigV4: signature :: Credentials -> DateTime -> CanonicalRequest -> Text
+ Service.FileUpload.BlobStore.S3.SigV4: signedHeaders :: Array (Text, Text) -> Text
+ Service.FileUpload.BlobStore.S3.SigV4: authorizationHeader :: Credentials -> DateTime -> CanonicalRequest -> Text
+ Service.FileUpload.BlobStore.S3.SigV4: sha256Hex :: Bytes -> Text
+ Service.FileUpload.BlobStore.S3.SigV4: uriEncode :: Text -> Text
+ Service.FileUpload.BlobStore.S3.SigV4: formatAmzDate :: DateTime -> Text
```

### Decisions carried from the review

- **Shape.** Same as `Local`: a config record and one constructor. No extra
  operations outside the `BlobStore` facade. Conditional writes
  (`If-None-Match`/`If-Match`) are **not** included: upstream dedup already
  guarantees "store derived content once" through the content-hash lookup in
  `Service.FileUpload.Web`, so the use case that motivated them is covered.
- **Provider-agnostic.** SigV4 + path-style addressing is the protocol shared
  by AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, Backblaze B2, MinIO and RustFS. Azure Blob Storage
  uses a different protocol (SharedKey REST) and is out of scope; it would be a
  sibling module `BlobStore/Azure.hs` with the same `Config`/`createBlobStore`
  shape.
- **Transport.** `Http.Client.sendSecure` (HTTPS, pinned TLS 1.2+, no
  redirects, no proxy, bounded response) for every endpoint;
  `Http.Client.Internal.sendRaw` only when the endpoint is a literal loopback
  address (local fixtures). The module imports nothing from `Network.HTTP.*`.
- **Credentials.** Read by the application (its `Config.hs`), passed in
  `S3Config` from `App.hs`. The backend never reads the environment.
  `S3Config` has no `Show` instance; `Http.Client.Request` redacts headers, so
  the `Authorization` value cannot reach logs. Per-file authorization is an
  application concern (the app's own grant/ownership aggregate) and needs no
  core convention or RFC; `Integration.Http.Auth` (JWT/OAuth) is unrelated.
- **Errors.** 404 on GET -> `NotFound`; 404 on HEAD -> `exists = False`; DELETE
  accepts 204/200/404 (idempotent). Any other status -> `StorageError "S3 HTTP
  <code>"` (status only; S3 error bodies may echo the request). Transport
  failures -> `StorageError` without the URL.
- **Testing.** No Docker, no live endpoint in CI. `SigV4Spec` reproduces the
  four worked examples of the AWS S3 API reference (GET Object, PUT Object,
  GET Bucket Lifecycle, GET Bucket) step by step. `S3Spec` drives the real
  facade against `FakeS3`, an in-process WAI/Warp fake of the S3 object API on
  a free loopback port. Verified before writing it: no reusable in-process HTTP
  stub exists in `core/test*` today (only inline `GhcWarp.run` calls in
  `Http/ClientRawSpec.hs`, `Http/ClientSpec.hs`,
  `Auth/OAuth2/TokenRefreshSpec.hs`). **Boundary of `FakeS3`** (maintainer
  request, so a future package split keeps it with the S3 backend): it lives
  under `core/test/Service/FileUpload/BlobStore/S3/`, speaks only the S3 wire
  protocol (PUT/GET/HEAD/DELETE, ETag, 200/204/404/403), depends only on
  wai/warp/http-types/network (already in `common_cfg`) and Core, imports
  nothing from the FileUpload service or other test infrastructure, and is
  imported only by `S3Spec`. A run against a real S3-compatible server stays a
  manual recipe (below), never a CI gate.

### Manual check against a real S3-compatible server (not a gate)

Disposable RustFS container on loopback, throw-away credentials, then point an
application (or a `cabal repl` session) at it:

```sh
export RUSTFS_ACCESS_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 12) RUSTFS_SECRET_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
docker run -d --name s3-manual --cap-drop ALL --security-opt no-new-privileges \
  -p 127.0.0.1::9000 --tmpfs /data --tmpfs /logs \
  -e RUSTFS_ACCESS_KEY -e RUSTFS_SECRET_KEY -e RUSTFS_CONSOLE_ENABLE=false \
  rustfs/rustfs:1.0.1
ENDPOINT="http://$(docker port s3-manual 9000/tcp)"
# create the bucket once (any S3 client, e.g. mc or aws cli), then in ghci:
#   S3.createBlobStore S3Config {endpoint = ENDPOINT, bucket = "manual", region = "us-east-1",
#                                accessKeyId = RUSTFS_ACCESS_KEY, secretAccessKey = RUSTFS_SECRET_KEY}
#   and exercise store / retrieve / exists / delete.
docker rm -f s3-manual
```

The same steps work against MinIO (`minio/minio`), Cloudflare R2, Backblaze
B2 and AWS S3 with an HTTPS endpoint.

| C8 | An unreachable endpoint maps to `StorageError` without the URL | `hspec:nhcore-test-service:core/test/Service/FileUpload/BlobStore/S3Spec.hs#an unreachable endpoint is a StorageError without the URL` | unit | none |

C3–C6 drive the real facade over loopback HTTP against `FakeS3`, the
in-process Warp listener started by `withFakeS3`, so they are `integration` /
`http:real`; `docs/changes/test-surfaces.json` attests each exact selector with
its `Service.FileUpload.BlobStore.S3` fixture group. C6's rejection example
uses the same fixture to prove that zero requests reach the wire. C1, C2 and
C7 stay `unit` / `none`: the signer is pure, and configuration validation
fails or succeeds inside `createBlobStore` without any network I/O. C8 also
stays `unit` / `none`: it only proves that a connection attempt to a closed
loopback port becomes a sanitized `StorageError`, and no fixture server ever
answers it.

`file-upload` is a security-sensitive capability: after Gate 1,
`./dev spec-check --plan` routes this change to the local-only security design
review (ADR-0069) before implementation is finalized.

## User impact

None breaking. New opt-in backend: in `App.hs` build
`S3.createBlobStore S3Config {endpoint, bucket, region, accessKeyId, secretAccessKey}`
from values your own `Config.hs` reads, and pass the resulting `BlobStore` to
`Application.withFileUpload` exactly as with `Local.createBlobStore`. Existing
applications on the local backend are unaffected. Limits: single-request
uploads (no multipart), objects are read fully into memory (bounded at 256 MiB
per GET), the bucket must already exist, no retries (a failed write may or may
not have landed; the error says so).

## ADR

Not required — no trigger (breaking / new-dependency / new-capability /
new-extension-point all false). The SigV4 implementation reuses `crypton` and
`memory`, which `nhcore` already depends on for `Crypto`. Design rationale
(provider scope, transport choice, testing boundary) is recorded above so the
maintainer approves it at Gate 1 together with the contract.
